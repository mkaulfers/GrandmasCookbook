Hi! I'm Matt, and I'm the developer for Grandma's Cookbook. This application came as inspiration for a problem that I face all the time. Do I have enough groceries, and how can I quickly plan my meals for the week. Currently the project is mid-development but under no time-constraint due to learning Android development in which Grandma's Cookbook will also be going to the Google Play store.
