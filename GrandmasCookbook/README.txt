Any other special requirements your instructor should know about

- Most of the work was done in the database as well as the UI/UX design. I've attached a report for RescueTime as well as WakaTime to show 20hr min requirement. Week 3 and 4 should have substantially more time in Xcode.

- The app is not pulling in any data from the API at this time, tableViews, filters, searching, and anything else related to that will not be viewable.
