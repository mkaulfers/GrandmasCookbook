Known bugs

- Cannot "back" out of the login screen
- Cannot "Reset Password"
- Input fields do not allow closing of the keyboard yet. 
- Progress bar removed
- Splash Screen Mis-Aligned
- Throwing error between loading view transition.
- Cached images are not loading properly at first. They load properly after a moment, may flicker incorrect images briefly.


Any other special requirements your instructor should know about

- Pantry, Shopping List are not implemented due to dependency on Saving Recipes for the "Home Page". 

- I have the searchable items in a format that will have to be updated periodically someIngredient;someIDValue so searching based on that has not yet been implemented.
